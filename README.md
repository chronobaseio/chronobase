## ChronoBase (BASE) token contract

Utility token for the ChronoBase project. 

Global decentralised luxury watch database with provenance, cost and ownership verification. 

Reliable and accessible database with watches registered by manufacturers and luxury watch owners. The entire provenance of your watch is inscribed in blockchain. Digital certificates issued by ChronoBase secure the buyers and enable to track and recover the lost or stolen items. 

ChronoBase is a unified ecosystem for luxury watch owners, dealers and manufacturers. We are creating a truly global ecosystem to store the watch profiles, with the current status (stolen, lost, or any other events), as well as their provenance and service history. ChronoBase will become a reliable and easily accessible decentralized database with the information on thousands of luxury watches, which are registered by manufacturers and owners. The entire lifecycle of a timepiece — from manufacturing to end user — will be recorded in blockchain, enabling value retention and a secure marketplace.
